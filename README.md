## Problem Question
The problem is that I want a goofy space adventure with all my friends along the way!

### Project Description
My client is someone who enjoys sci-fi games. Many sci-fi games are very serious, like Mass Effect and Halo. My client's problem is that they miss goofy space adventures like Roger Wilco's in the Space Quest series, or they love sci-fi literature like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! My client wants something that combines fun gameplay, sci-fi, and comedic writing.
