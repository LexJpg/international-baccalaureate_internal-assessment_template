# Home Planet Recovery Force!

## Problem Question
Archer loves playing video games. He loves playing different types of video games, however his favorite genres are missing things that he feels would be fun to have. He's entrusted me with the task of making him a game with elements from all of his respective favorite genres, and to incorperate new things that he hasn't tried that he might like.

### Project Description
My client has told me through his 3 interviews what exactly it is that he likes about his favorite Games and what new things he wants to see.

As Archer said, he would want a game to be funny, and because he's mostly concerned with story and decision making elements, I should incorporate comedic writing in the form of in game text. He complained about the gameplay of his favorite game however, stating that, "the gameplay elements besides that are pretty lacking." My client does however like space shooter games, so I'll impliment three space shooter levels in addition to the story. My client also wants some point and click elements, so I'll impliment a level where you can interact with the environment to solve a puzzle. Overall, my client wants something that combines fun gameplay, sci-fi, and comedic writing.

#### Interview Notes
Interview 1, Archer
* Question: What is your favorite game at the moment?
* Archer: I really like the telltale Batman series, mostly cause I like batman.
* Question: What's your favorite part about that game?
* Archer: I liked the decision making, in the end the Joker could become your friend which was pretty interesting, the problem is that the actual gameplay elements besides that are pretty lacking, so decision making should be paired with other genres. It's also not very funny.
* Question: Would you want decision making in this game?
* Archer: Sure! It adds to replayability.
* Question: What setting would you like the game to be?
* Archer: I've been really into Star Wars lately so I think that a sci-fi setting would be cool.
* Question: What are your expectations for the graphics
* Archer: I expect them, probably, uh, not to be amazing but I'm capable of enjoying games without good graphics so that's not a big deal.
* Question: Would you want a soundtrack?
* Archer: Yeah sure that sounds pretty cool, adds to the atmosphere I guess.

Interview 2, Archer
* Question: What is a game genre you enjoy that rarely has story elements?
* Archer: Space shooters like Galaga.
* Question: What's your favorite part about that game?
* Archer: I like the enemy variety, if there was only one enemy in that game it would be kind of boring. OH! And the final bosses, they're cool.

Interview 3, Archer
* Question: What is a genre you've yet to explore that has previously exceeded in storytelling elemets?
* Archer: Point and click adventure games probably. You love 999 and Phoenix Wright for their story, and I haven't played either of them (no matter how much I tell him to). I haven't played any point and click games like that so I'd like to try those.
* Question: What sounds the coolest about that kind of game?
* Archer: Since you've talked about it so much I'd like to try the puzzle solving.

#### Scenario
* My client is my friend Archer. He really enjoys the decision making of story games, the enemy variety and bosses of space shooters and he's looking to explore a new genre a little bit which is point and click adventures.
* My client is looking for a Sci-fi, Point and click space shooter with a wacky story.
* I propose this as my project: It has been discovered that in ancient times our people, which these ancients called “humans”, first roamed this planet, which we’ve cleverly called, Home Planet. Since we must be the first ones there, for supreme discovery clout, we have embarked on our mission to recover our planet. This I call, Home Planet Recovery Force! However, there is one issue. The museum back on Arlandis wants something to put in the museum, an ancient artifact, preferably one of great historical meaning. It’s your job to escort this object across the cosmos, where you might be a target due to the knowledge of our mission, and how much one of these things would sell on the black market. Venture forth travelers! And deliver this object within 20 days free shipping!

#### Rationale
* I'm going to build a game in visual studios.
* I'm going to use visual studios and download the SFML library, which I've done before and might actually be easier for me as someone with c++ experience and experience working with the library.
* SFML and Visual Studios are free and open source.
* SFML allows me to add graphics to a story I can tell in the visual studios console.
* SFML also allows button clicks to affect actions on screen.
* The Visual Studios console allows decision making through user input.
* I can export the final product in the form of a demo.
